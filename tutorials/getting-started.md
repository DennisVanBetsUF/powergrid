Getting Started
===============

To create a PowerGrid you need three components:
 - an HTML element to contain the grid,
 - a datasource to provide data to the grid,
 - a settings object.
 
The HTML element
----------------

This can be any DIV in your web page. In the most simple situation this will look like this:
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My first grid</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="powergrid"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```
